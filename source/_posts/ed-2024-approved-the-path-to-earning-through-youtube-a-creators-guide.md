### Video length

One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.

### Ad Quality

The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what's happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you're looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Number of clicks each ad receives

The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads' revenue potential by increasing the ad's number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.

### Ad Blockers

And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.

### Ad Quality

The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what's happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you're looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.

### Number of clicks each ad receives

The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads' revenue potential by increasing the ad's number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.

### Ad Blockers

And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.

### 3\. How much money does 1 million views make?

For every one million views a YouTube video gets, a YouTuber can make upwards of $5000, based on [Forbes's](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/relationships/how-much-do-youtubers-make/#:~:text=their%20videos.%20Using-,Forbes%E2%80%99s,-estimated%20pay%20rate) estimated pay rate of $5\. However, these are estimates, and the amount YouTubers earn from Youtube varies wildly.

## Final Words

This article is a pretty good overview of the "how" of YouTube monetization, though we would also add that it can take a while to build up a following on YouTube if you're starting. You'll want to ensure that you put enough time and effort into your videos.

Your content must be unique so your viewers will want to stick around and engage with you. And lastly, if you're looking to monetize your YouTube channel, focus on building your channel and growing your audience.
