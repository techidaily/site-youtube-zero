In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel’s home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio"                ></p><p>You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p><p>2. Once the Creator Studio opens, you’ll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.</p><p>3. You’ll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-community-create-studio.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio"                ></p><p>4. Select the Subscribers option from the menu and wait for the list of the subscribers to appear on your screen. You’ll be able to see a list of YouTube users that have subscribed to your channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg"                      alt="Finding YouTube Subscribers"                ></p><p>Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.</p><p>If you would like to go through a more detailed tutorial about how to see who your subscribers are, click <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKndwFejMow" >here and learn each step of this simple process. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re using YouTube Studio, you can go to the <strong>Recent subscribers</strong> card on the Dashboard, and then click <strong>SEE ALL</strong> to check the list of the recent subscribers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="See YouTube Subscriber"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-See-Which-of-Your-Subscribers-are-the-Most-Popular"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-See-Which-of-Your-Subscribers-are-the-Most-Popular" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular"></a>Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular</h2><p>The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube’s Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do.

When you visit YouTube after installing TubeBuddy a whole new set of useful tools becomes available.</p><p>TubeBuddy’s tools were designed to save you time and effort when performing some of the more mundane tasks involved in running a YouTube channel, like adding cards. Many of TubeBuddy’s tools are completely free to use, but others might require a paid license. There are three levels of licensing: $9, $19, or $39 per month.</p><h4 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube"></a>The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube</h4><ol><li><a href="#productivity"><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bulk"><strong>Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></a></li><li><a href="#tags"><strong>Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#data"><strong>Useful Data</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Benefits-of-TubeBuddy"><a href="#Benefits-of-TubeBuddy" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of TubeBuddy"></a><strong>Benefits of TubeBuddy</strong></h2><p>YouTubers who use TubeBuddy are able to spend less time on busy-work and more time on coming up with creative video ideas. Here are some of the ways TubeBuddy can help you, especially if you have a large or mid-sized channel:</p><h4 id="1-Increased-Productivity"><a href="#1-Increased-Productivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Increased Productivity"></a><strong>1. Increased Productivity</strong></h4><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s Productivity Tools are available for free, but some require a $9 per month Pro license.</p><p>You can use these tools to get your videos ready for posting faster, embed them off-YouTube more easily, and save time by creating canned responses or templates for cards and annotations.</p><p>For example, you might find yourself creating the same YouTube Card over and over again to include it in every video you make. Creating a template through TubeBuddy will save you this effort.</p><p>Another great productivity tool is the Video Topic Planner. You can save video ideas you come up with, or ideas viewers have suggested to you, and arrange them in a queue so you never forget what you are planning to make next.</p><h4 id="2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More"><a href="#2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More" class="headerlink" title="2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More"></a><strong>2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></h4><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubebuddy-bulk-tools.jpg"                      alt="TubeBuddy bulk tools"                ></strong></p><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s bulk processing tools require a $19 per month Star license.</p><p>Two of the most time-saving tools in this section are the Bulk Copy tools for cards and annotations. They will save you from having to recreate the same ones over and over. Then, using the Bulk Update tools, you will be able to make changes to all of your cards or annotations at once.</p><p>For example: if you use a YouTube Card to link to your personal website and include it in every video, and then you change your website, you change the link in all of your existing cards at once.</p><p>Another useful Bulk tool is Bulk Thumbnail Overlays, which will allow you to add a logo to all of your existing video thumbnails at once.</p><h4 id="3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags"></a><strong>3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></h4><p>The SEO Tools in TubeBuddy will help you find the best tags for your videos and suggest tags you might want to target. Many of these tools are free, but others require a $19 Star license.</p><p>One of the best free tools in this category is View and Copy Video Tags. It allows you to see and copy the tags of other people’s videos. You will be able to see which keywords your competitors are targeting (and look for opportunities to target them more effectively). This can also save you a lot of time writing out tags that should really be the same as the ones on an existing video.</p><h4 id="4-Useful-Data"><a href="#4-Useful-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Useful Data"></a><strong>4. Useful Data</strong></h4><p>The most useful piece of data under Data and Research Tools is the Best Time to Publish. How many views you get on a video could vary greatly depending on when you post, and the best times to post vary depending on the demographics of your audience. This free tool from TubeBuddy will show you when you should be uploading.</p><p>Another interesting tool, which is unfortunately only available with $39 licenses, is the Competitor Scoreboard.

Here are 15 alternative places where you can get royalty-free music for free! It’ll say at the beginning of every section whether they require attribution or allow commercial use.</p><h2 id="Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download"><a href="#Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download" class="headerlink" title="Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]"></a>Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]</h2><p>If you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will find there are some royalty-free music tracks and sound effects already pre-programmed in the Audio library.

Audionautix"></a>1. Audionautix</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p><p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p><p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p><p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p><p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p><h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2. Bensound"></a>2. Bensound</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bensound.jpg"                      alt="Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos -Bensound"                ></p><p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p><p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p><h4 id="3-dig-ccMixter"><a href="#3-dig-ccMixter" class="headerlink" title="3. dig.ccMixter"></a>3. dig.ccMixter</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends.</em> Some songs are available for commercial use, some are not. It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p><p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ccmixter.JPG"                      alt="Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - dig.ccMixter"                ></p><p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p><p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p><p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p><p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p><p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p><h4 id="4-Free-Music-Archive"><a href="#4-Free-Music-Archive" class="headerlink" title="4. Free Music Archive"></a>4. Free Music Archive</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-music-archive.JPG"                      alt="Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - Free Music Archive"                ></p><p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p><p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p><p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p><h4 id="5-Free-Stock-Music"><a href="#5-Free-Stock-Music" class="headerlink" title="5. Free Stock Music"></a>5. Free Stock Music</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p><p>Simply choose a genre from the ‘Free Music’ drop-down menu to start browsing Free Stock Music’s collection. There are 10 genres including Pop, Hip Hop, and Corporate.</p><p>There are not a lot of ways to customize your search results on this site. You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p><p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p><p>You need to create a free account on Free Stock Music to access their songs.</p><h4 id="6-Incompetech"><a href="#6-Incompetech" class="headerlink" title="6. Incompetech"></a>6. Incompetech</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>YouTube monetization allowed.</em> Other kinds of commercial use may be restricted.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can put the attribution in your video description.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you cannot (or do not want to) credit Incompetech then you can purchase a license instead. Licensing 1 piece of music costs $30.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/incompetech.JPG"                      alt="Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - Incompetech"                ></p><p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p><p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p><p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p><p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p><p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p><h4 id="7-Josh-Woodward"><a href="#7-Josh-Woodward" class="headerlink" title="7. Josh Woodward"></a>7. Josh Woodward</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Attribution goes in your description box and it should look like this: Music - “SONG TITLE HERE” by Josh Woodward. Free download: <a class="link"   href="http://joshwoodward.com/" >http://joshwoodward.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you cannot give Josh credit for some reason you can buy a single-song license for $30.</p><p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p><p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p><p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p><p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p><p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p><p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p><p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p><h4 id="8-Looperman"><a href="#8-Looperman" class="headerlink" title="8. Looperman"></a>8. Looperman</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed for loops, but they make no guarantees.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Unclear.</em> The site doesn’t address attribution so it may be up to whoever has uploaded the loop you want to use.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p><p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p><h4 id="9-Moby-Gratis"><a href="#9-Moby-Gratis" class="headerlink" title="9. Moby Gratis"></a>9. Moby Gratis</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Never allowed.</em> You cannot make money from the project you use this music in any way, including YouTube monetization or through a service like Patreon.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Put this in your video description: Music: [Track Name] by Moby courtesy of Mobygratis.com</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p><p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p><p>In order to download songs, you will need to make an account, and it takes about 24 hours for your account to be approved.</p><h4 id="10-Musopen"><a href="#10-Musopen" class="headerlink" title="10. Musopen"></a>10. Musopen</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Depends on the song</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p><p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p><p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p><p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p><h4 id="11-TeknoAXE"><a href="#11-TeknoAXE" class="headerlink" title="11. TeknoAXE"></a>11. TeknoAXE</h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>All of the music on TeknoAXE is covered under a CC4.0 license, which means you can share and adapt the music for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.</p><p>TeknoAXE’s music is divided into four categories: electronic dance music, rock and metal music, orchestra and soundtrack, and miscellaneous. There are several sub-categories under every category.</p><p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p><p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p><h4 id="12-PacDV"><a href="#12-PacDV" class="headerlink" title="12.

There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p><p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p><h4 id="13-Partners-In-Rhyme"><a href="#13-Partners-In-Rhyme" class="headerlink" title="13.

At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p><p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p><p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p><h4 id="14-Purple-Planet-Music"><a href="#14-Purple-Planet-Music" class="headerlink" title="14.

The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p><p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p><h4 id="15-Sounds-Crate"><a href="#15-Sounds-Crate" class="headerlink" title="15.

This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.</p><p>To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to, we’ve compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We’ve also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Types of Videos on YouTube"></a>4 Types of Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website. This platform contains over <strong>600,000</strong> unlisted YouTube videos from 2016 and earlier. You can also submit your unlisted video on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/using-the-unlisted-videos-website-to-see-hidden-videos.png"                      alt="unlisted videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the search bar at the top of your screen to search for other people’s YouTube playlists. You can also click the <strong>“All Video”</strong> or <strong>“Random Videos”</strong> option to find the hidden content of a user.</p><h3 id="How-To-See-Unlisted-Videos-on-My-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#How-To-See-Unlisted-Videos-on-My-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="How To See Unlisted Videos on My YouTube Channel?"></a>How To See Unlisted Videos on My YouTube Channel?</h3><p>To see your unlisted videos on your YouTube channel, do the following steps in sequence:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.creator&hl=en&gl=US" >YouTube Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your mobile device or visit its <a class="link"   href="https://studio.youtube.com/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using a browser on your computer.

Therefore, if you have any older unlisted videos added to your Playlist or embedded on your website, you won’t be able to access them now.</p><p>However, the channel’s owner can restore access to the video by switching it back to unlisted or public. If now, the video will be labeled as <strong>“Private”</strong> indefinitely or until its settings are changed.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this detailed guide, we’ve explored the four types of videos on YouTube and how to find YouTube hidden videos in three different ways.

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p><p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p><p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p><h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p><p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p><p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p><p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p><h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p><p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p><p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p><h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p><p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p><p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p><h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p><p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p><p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p><p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p><p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p><h2 id="Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber"><a href="#Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber" class="headerlink" title="Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber"></a>Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber</h2><p>Since YouTube is a video platform, your video is what attracts your subscribers.

First, let’s see the minimum eligibility requirements to join Youtube Partner Program.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Emma Chamberlain - $12 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Roman Atwood – $14.5 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">JJ Olatunji (AKA KSI) – $15 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Stevin John (AKA Blippi) – $16 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sean McLoughlin (AKA Jacksepticeye) – $16 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-6">David Dobrik – $20 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-7">Anastasia Radzinskaya (AKA Like Nastya) – $20 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-8">Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal – $20 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-9">Lilly Singh – $20 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-10">Preston Arsement – $20 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-11">James Charles – $22 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-12">Evan Fong – $25 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-13">Jimmy Donaldson (AKA MrBeast) – $25 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-14">Daniel Middleton – $35 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-15">Mark Fischbach (AKA Markiplier) – $35 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-16">Felix Kjellberg (AKA PewDiePie) – $40 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-17">Logan Paul – $45 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-18">Dude Perfect - $50 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-19">Jake Paul – $60 million</a></li><li><a href="#part3-20">Ryan Kaji – $100 million</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Alternative ways to earn more money from YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on YouTube channel monetization</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-When-does-youtube-pay-you-threshold-to-meet"><a href="#Part-1-When-does-youtube-pay-you-threshold-to-meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: When does youtube pay you [threshold to meet]"></a>Part 1: When does youtube pay you [threshold to meet]</h2><p>As a YouTuber, do you feel like you’re always struggling to reach some “threshold” where YouTube finally starts rewarding your efforts with some financial reward? You came to the right place; here’s a list of Youtube minimum criteria to reach the threshold.</p><h3 id="1-1K-subscribers"><a href="#1-1K-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="1. 1K subscribers"></a>1. 1K subscribers</h3><p>The first requirement to monetize your channel is to increase your subscribers to at least 1000.</p><h3 id="2-Follow-all-the-YouTube-channel-monetization-policies"><a href="#2-Follow-all-the-YouTube-channel-monetization-policies" class="headerlink" title="2.

We’ll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length"><a href="#Video-length" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><h3 id="Ad-Quality"><a href="#Ad-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads’ revenue potential by increasing the ad’s number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.</p><h3 id="Ad-Blockers"><a href="#Ad-Blockers" class="headerlink" title="Ad Blockers"></a>Ad Blockers</h3><p>And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.</p><h3 id="Bonus-See-how-much-you-can-get-by-YouTube-Pay-Calculator"><a href="#Bonus-See-how-much-you-can-get-by-YouTube-Pay-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator"></a>Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator</h3><p>Calculating your potential earnings from YouTube is a great way to see if it is worth your time to start a channel and create videos for certain niches. It can also help you set realistic expectations for the average earnings you can expect.</p><p>A YouTube pay calculator is a simple way to estimate how much money you can make from your YouTube channel.

The process that is given below explains how to view your past YouTube comments on an iPhone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign In to Your YouTube Account on an Internet Browser</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser on your iPhone (Safari, the default one, is used here for illustration), go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, tap the profile icon from the top-right corner, tap <strong>Sign in</strong> from the menu that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions to use your Google account credentials to sign in to YouTube.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access the Desktop Version of YouTube</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>More Options</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the browser, and then tap <strong>Request Desktop Website</strong> from the menu that appears to access the desktop version of YouTube on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/request-desktop-website-youtube.jpg"                      alt="Access the Desktop Version of YouTube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: View Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears. On the <strong>History</strong> page, tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the right pane to view&#x2F;access your YouTube comments that you posted in the past.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-past-youtube-comments-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Access the Desktop Version of YouTube"                ></p><h3 id="3-Find-Your-YouTube-Comments-on-an-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#3-Find-Your-YouTube-Comments-on-an-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="3. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone"></a>3. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone</h3><p>As it is with iOS, the YouTube app for Android doesn’t allow you to view your comments history either. However, the workaround of using a web browser works pretty well on Android smartphones too, but with a few tweaks. The process of doing so is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use a Web Browser to Sign In to Your YouTube Account</strong></p><p>Launch <strong>Google Chrome</strong> on your Android smartphone (you can use any other web browser of your choice), and go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Notice how the interface automatically changes to the desktop version. <strong>Note:</strong> If the desktop version of the website isn’t visible, you can tap the <strong>More</strong> button (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the <strong>Desktop site</strong> box.</p><p>Next, tap <strong>SIGN IN</strong> from the top-right corner of the YouTube page, enter your Google account credentials in the box available on the <strong>Sign in</strong> screen, enter your password when prompted, and sign in to your YouTube account.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose a Web Browser (for Confirmation)</strong></p><p>When the confirmation box pops up at the bottom, choose your preferred web browser, and tap the frequency of its usage for accessing YouTube. For instance, choose <strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>Just once</strong> to use <strong>Google Chrome</strong> to access YouTube only for this session.</p><p><strong>Step 3: View&#x2F;Access Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Once you are signed in to your account, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears. When the <strong>History</strong> page opens up, tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the right pane to view and&#x2F;or access your past YouTube comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?"></a>Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?</h2><p>If you own a YouTube channel and have posted several videos there, it is likely that you also have received a decent number of comments. Usually, these remarks are pretty helpful as they tell you how to improve your production quality, and what your audience prefers to watch in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to find all the comments that your YouTube channel has received, and the process given below explains exactly that:</p><h3 id="1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer"><a href="#1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="1. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer"></a>1. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer</h3><p>You can use your favorite web browser on a PC to easily find all the comments that the videos on your YouTube channel have received as long as you are signed in to your Google account. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the Your videos Page</strong></p><p>Open your favorite Internet browser, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >https://www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and sign in to your YouTube account as explained in the previous sections. Next, click the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube homepage, and click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-your-videos-menu.jpg"                      alt="Access  YouTube Your videos Page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: View the Comments</strong></p><p>Make sure that the <strong>Uploads</strong> tab is selected on the <strong>Channel content</strong> window, and check the number under the <strong>Comments</strong> column of each video to see how many comments that particular film has received. You can click the number for any video to view its comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-video-comments-list.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments List"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Hide or Hold a Comment for Approval</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>More</strong> icon from the right of the comment you want to moderate, and click <strong>Hide user from channel</strong> or <strong>Always approve comments from this user</strong> to hide the comments from the selected user or keep their comments on hold until you review and approve them respectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-specific-user-comment-moderation.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments List"                ></p><p>Note: To view all comments received on your YouTube channel, go to the Comments tab under YouTube Studio, and you will find all Channel comments &amp; mentions.</p><h3 id="2-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Mobile-App"><a href="#2-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App"></a>2. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App</h3><p>This process is comparatively simpler than the previous one as all that you need to do is download the YT Studio app, and access a central location where all the comments for all the videos can be viewed. The process is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Obtain a Mobile App</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play Store</strong>, and search and download the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app on your iPhone or Android smartphone (iPhone X is used here for illustration).</p><p><strong>Step 2: View&#x2F;Access All the Comments</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app, and sign in to your YouTube account. Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the interface, and tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the menu to view all the published comments for all the videos that you have received on your YouTube channel.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Hide Users and View Held Comments</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>More</strong> button from the right of an inappropriate comment, and tap <strong>Hide user from channel</strong> from the menu that comes up. In addition, you can tap the <strong>More</strong> button next to <strong>Published</strong> from the top, and tap <strong>Held for review</strong> from the box that pops up to view the comments that are waiting for your approval.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unfortunately, you cannot hold the comments for approval using the YT Studio app. As a workaround, you can follow the procedure given earlier to access the desktop version of YouTube on your smartphone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to get this done. However, it is recommended that you do all such sensitive tasks on a laptop or desktop computer to avoid any errors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-channel-comments-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments mobile"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name"><a href="#Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name"></a>Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name</h2><p>If any of your YouTube videos has thousands of comments and you need to find a particular one from a specific user, checking each remark manually would be an extremely time-consuming and tedious task. Therefore, it is a good idea to let an efficient application do the job for you.</p><p>One program, a Google Chrome extension called YCS – YouTube Comment Search to be precise, can help you with this. All you are required to do is, install the extension, go to the video, and search the comment by the name of the user. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install YCS – YouTube Comment Search</strong></p><p>Launch Google Chrome on your desktop or laptop computer, search for <strong>YCS – YouTube Comment Search</strong>, click <strong>Add to Chrome</strong>, and click <strong>Add extension</strong> on the notification box that pops up to install the YCS – YouTube Comment Search extension on your instance of Google Chrome.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Load All Comments</strong></p><p>Go to your or any other’s YouTube video, and click <strong>Load All</strong> from the top-right corner of the YouTube Comment Search panel that is present under the description box to allow YCS to scan all the comments the video has received.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/load-all-comments-with-youtube-comment-search-extension.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments mobile"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Search Comments from a Particular User</strong></p><p>Choose <strong>Comments</strong> from the search type drop-down list, enter the name of the user in question in the <strong>Search</strong> box, and click <strong>Search</strong> to fetch all their comments on the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-comment-from-specific-user-with-ycs-extension.jpg"                      alt="Serach  YouTube Comments of specific users"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Edit-and-Reply-to-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Edit-and-Reply-to-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Edit and Reply to YouTube Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Edit and Reply to YouTube Comments?</h2><p>Editing an existing YouTube comment that you have posted earlier, or replying to the one published by someone else is simple.

Therefore, you might want to moderate all your comments before they become visible to the audience so as not to spread negativity among the mass. Fortunately, YouTube helps you get this done easily, and the instructions that teach you the process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to Your Channel’s Settings Box</strong></p><p>Sign in to your YouTube account, click the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the homepage, and click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p>From the bottom of the navigation bar on the left of the <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> page, click <strong>Settings</strong> to open the channel’s <strong>Settings</strong> box.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Moderate YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Go to the <strong>Community</strong> category from the left pane, and go to the <strong>Defaults</strong> tab from the right. Next, choose <strong>Hide all comments for review</strong> from the <strong>Comments on your new videos</strong> drop-down list, and click <strong>SAVE</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the box to moderate all YouTube comments that your new videos receive from this point onward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-youtube-community-comments-moderaiton.jpg"                      alt="set  YouTube Community Comments moderation"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-Writing-Good-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-Writing-Good-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments"></a>Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments</h2><p>While posting a comment on a YouTube video, it is imperative to keep a few things in mind. Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:</p><ul><li>Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can</li><li>Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency</li><li>Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment</li><li>In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble</li><li>Ignore the replies with inappropriate content</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About YouTube Comments"></a>FAQs About YouTube Comments</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.</p><p>In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving. Having better data and understanding of how an individual video or an entire channel is performing will help creators succeed on this ever more competitive platform.</p><p><em>Have you tried the new YouTube Studio (Beta)?

A teacher should start a YouTube channel because it is beneficial to their students and themselves. The materials or content dished on these channels helps give lessons and instructions in the absence of the teacher, give a detailed explanation and trigger the students’ interest.</p><p>Also, it archives all the lessons for a long time and makes them easily accessible by both the present, past, and future students. Students can quickly go back for a review for upcoming exams. Through feedbacks or comments, teachers can provide answers to students with the problem of clarity.</p><p>A teacher needs to know what an educational video is, what makes an excellent educational video, and <strong>how to make an educational video for YouTube</strong> before opening a YouTube channel. Now, let’s delve into it!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?"></a>Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?</h2><p>From the name “educational video,” you can coin out that it is a video made for the sole purpose of educating or passing out knowledge for the sake of learning. The primary purpose of these videos is to teach an audience about a particular problem or important topics they want to learn about.</p><p>Sometimes brands use this method to advertise their brand while being a source of information.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?"></a>Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?</h2><p>An excellent educational video aids the learning process. It triggers learners in analyzing and evaluating concepts provided by the video. Videos are great educational tools that most teachers must adopt due to their role in facilitating the learning process.</p><p>To make a good educational video, you should keep the following points in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your students engaged</strong></li></ul><p>An excellent educational video should be eye catchy and exciting to get your student’s undivided attention. You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about. Ask them questions, let them feel involved in the process. Please don’t go ahead talking with a cold tune. It makes them tired of listening or seeing the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length</strong></li></ul><p>It’s better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It’s almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.</p><p>The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between <strong>2 - 20 minutes</strong> long.</p><p>Most importantly, don’t try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay focused</strong></li></ul><p>Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Center your interest on the student’s needs</strong></li></ul><p>Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

After all, nobody will watch your video or read your blog if they can’t find it, right? A blogger would do this by lacing their content with SEO - search engine optimization. But how can a YouTuber do the same? The answer lies in something known as YouTube tags optimization.

You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this case, it is important to let the YouTube algorithm know your video by adding related tags to have a higher ranking. So the better tags we choose, the higher chance to rank in the top 1, which means you will get more views!</p><p>Using YouTube meta tags wisely can broaden your reach and help new people discover your content. However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all. What you need to do is find what you are missing and try to cover that area. However, only third-party tools can help you do that. In the market, <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is highly used. It has a free version.

You can use singular and plural tags. Sometimes remember to add some misspelling tags because users tend to mistype some words, so it’s better to cover this kind of tag.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title"><a href="#1-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too. We have collected a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to improve your YouTube meta, so check out the suggestions and work forwards from there.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Research your keywords and include high traffic keywords at the start of the title</li><li>Keep titles under 70 characters</li><li>Branding, episode number, and other non-essential info should be at the end of the title</li><li>Review your YouTube titles from time to time and update with new keywords as search trends change</li><li>Avoid clickbait titles or misleading titles as this will affect your view time and subsequently your ranking in search</li></ul><h3 id="2-Description"><a href="#2-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Description"></a>2. Description</h3><p>Your description is a much longer piece of YouTube meta, so you can really go to town with your YouTube keywords here. You’ve got up to 5,000 characters to fill in, and we strongly advise that you aim to use every single one. This really is a golden opportunity, not only to get people motivated to watch all of your video, but also to be indexed correctly through well researched YouTube keywords.</p><p>You may have noticed that, on the search page itself, only a small part of the description actually shows up; 120 characters of it to be precise. This doesn’t affect indexing, but it does mean you have to plan your YouTube description carefully to really hook people into clicking through from just the first sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Make the first sentence or two compelling and captivating to get people to click</li><li>Research the best YouTube keywords to use to ensure your video is correctly indexed</li><li>At the end of your YouTube description, include a call to action to direct viewers on what to do next (subscribe, click through to the website, look at a product, watch more videos, etc.)</li><li>If your video is long, consider placing time codes in your description to help users jump to their areas of interest</li><li>Add links to products showcased, your social channels, or website as you wish</li><li>Don’t forget to credit any music you’ve used here</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description"></a>Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</h2><p>So, now we’ve got the basics down, let’s move on to some top tips for getting your metadata just right:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on. For this reason, you should look to update your meta from time to time, at least once every six months or so. Re-research your keywords and optimize for today’s trending search terms.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Take some time to perfect your meta on YouTube and see how many more views it helps you get.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks"></a>2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Watching someone perform an everyday task"></a>3. Watching someone perform an everyday task</h3><p>Seeing someone draw, paint, chop up food, or even write on a piece of paper can trigger the ASMR. Some people find the visual aspect of these actions relaxing, which in turn helps them get rid of the stress and sleep better.</p><h3 id="4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking"><a href="#4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking" class="headerlink" title="4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking"></a>4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking</h3><p>Chewing food loudly or slurping can generate a tingling sensation at the top of your head that later spreads through the entire body.</p><h3 id="5-Getting-attention"><a href="#5-Getting-attention" class="headerlink" title="5. Getting attention"></a>5. Getting attention</h3><p>Although almost everyone likes receiving attention, some people have a strong ASMR reaction to being the center of someone’s attention.</p><h3 id="6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors"><a href="#6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors" class="headerlink" title="6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors"></a>6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface" class="headerlink" title="7. Tapping on a surface"></a>7. Tapping on a surface</h3><p>Tapping on the surface of a microphone or the surface of plastic or metal objects is yet another common ASMR trigger. The reparative tapping sound initiates a pleasant sensation that relaxes a person.</p><h3 id="8-A-hand-touching-a-face"><a href="#8-A-hand-touching-a-face" class="headerlink" title="8. A hand touching a face"></a>8. A hand touching a face</h3><p>Tactile stimuli like a hand touching a face are known to be ASMR triggers. Besides touching a face, touching someone’s hand or hair can also trigger ASMR.</p><h3 id="9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music"><a href="#9-Hearing-a-particular-genre-of-music" class="headerlink" title="9. Hearing a particular genre of music"></a>9. Hearing a particular genre of music</h3><p>People who love music often have a physical reaction to it. Hearing your favorite genre of music can produce the ASMR sensation.</p><h3 id="10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic"><a href="#10-Listening-to-someone-exhale-into-a-mic" class="headerlink" title="10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
