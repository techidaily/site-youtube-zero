## Part 4: How YouTube's Playback Speed Controls Work?

YouTube has an added feature known as 'playback speed.' This feature allows you to select a speed from 0.25x to 2x the normal speed. With this **YouTube's speed control**, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1/4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.

However, in as much as **YouTube speed control** slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.

Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.

If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can **fast forward YouTube** video by using the feature.

Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this **YouTube speed control**.

**Conclusion**

**YouTube speed control** has made it easier to change **YouTube playback speed** to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.
