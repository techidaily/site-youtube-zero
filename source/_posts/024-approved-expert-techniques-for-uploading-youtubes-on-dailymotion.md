It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

## Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion

You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video.
