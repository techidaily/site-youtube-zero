 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Achieving a state of peace and tranquility isn’t always easy, in fact, a growing number of studies indicate that most people find it difficult to relax after a long day. The ensuing stress can cause insomnia, anxiety, depression, and a broad range of other psychological problems.

ASMR videos are a booming trend on YouTube as channels that post this type of content are attracting millions of followers. These videos contain audio and visual stimuli that can trigger the autonomous sensory meridian response that is characterized by the tingling which spreads from the top of the head downward.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best ASMR YouTube channels and help you discover the one that relaxes you the most.

## Part 1: The Best ASMR Sleep Channels

The staggering amount of ASMR content on YouTube makes finding the channels that offer videos that help the viewer fall asleep a difficult task. We’ve combed through YouTube in search of the best ASMR Sleep channels, so let's take a closer look at our selection.

### 1\. [ASMR Darling](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCikebqFWoT3QC9axUbXCPYw)

The ASMR Darling channel was started in 2014 and since then it gained a massive following. Today, it has more than 2.5 million subscribers which makes it one of the most successful ASMR channels on YouTube.

The videos are focused around visual and audio ASMR triggers as their host usually uses whispering, role play, tapping, scratching, and microphone brushing. In addition, some videos also contain compliments, affirmations, and face touching that can potentially serve as tactile ASMR triggers. Each video on the ASMR Darling channel is created with the aim to relax the viewer and help them unwind before falling asleep.

### 2\. [Pelagea ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNlMeUt5nOTQ-yfjXzRKVKA)

With nearly one million subscribers Pelagea ASMR is easily one of the most popular ASMR sleep channels on YouTube. The duration of an average video on this channel exceeds twenty minutes which helps the viewer fall asleep while the video they are watching is still playing in the background.

The content on this channel is usually focused on audio triggers as the video that contains kissing noises has more than 19 million views. In addition, the host of these videos often taps her long fingernails over different types of objects. One thing is certain, the content you’ll find on this channel will alleviate the migraines you’re experiencing and improve the quality of your sleep.
