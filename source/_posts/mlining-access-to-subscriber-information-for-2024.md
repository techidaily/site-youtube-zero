## Part 1: How to See Your YouTube Subscribers List?

Finding out who your subscribers are on YouTube is a simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

1\. In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel's home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.

![YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg)

You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.

2\. Once the Creator Studio opens, you'll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.

3\. You'll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.

4\. Select the Subscribers option from the menu and wait for the list of the subscribers to appear on your screen. You'll be able to see a list of YouTube users that have subscribed to your channel.

![Finding YouTube Subscribers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg)

Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.

If you would like to go through a more detailed tutorial about how to see who your subscribers are, click [here and learn each step of this simple process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKndwFejMow)

If you’re using YouTube Studio, you can go to the **Recent subscribers** card on the Dashboard, and then click **SEE ALL** to check the list of the recent subscribers.

## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)
