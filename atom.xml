Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:</p><p>These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:</p><ol><li><a href="#youtubegrabber1">YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber2">BoingBoing</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber3">Thumbnailsave.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber4">Get YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber5">Fbutube.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber6">YT Thumbnail Downloader</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber7">Youtubethumbnailimage.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber8">Youthumbnail.com</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber"><a href="#1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber" class="headerlink" title="#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"></a>#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/" >https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!</p><h2 id="2-BoingBoing"><a href="#2-BoingBoing" class="headerlink" title="#2: BoingBoing"></a>#2: BoingBoing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg"                      alt="Boing Boing"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html" >https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images. Although it is one step faster than YouTube Thumbnail Grabber, you will have to deal with having to view one small ad at the bottom of the page. In case you also want to download freeze frames that occur midway through the video, BoingBoing also gives you the option to download those images as well.</p><h2 id="3-Thumbnailsave-com"><a href="#3-Thumbnailsave-com" class="headerlink" title="#3: Thumbnailsave.com"></a>#3: Thumbnailsave.com</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail-save.jpg"                      alt="Thumbnail Save"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://thumbnailsave.com/" >http://thumbnailsave.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Another free, straightforward website for grabbing your YouTube thumbnails is Thumbnailsave.com. Again, all you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click the “Submit” button. Unlike our first two options, this site has a lot more ads. You’ll see a banner ad at the top as well as an ad to the side of the page. One interesting thing about this website is that it displays a column of thumbnails recently grabbed by users all over the world (displayed on the right side of the page). You might find this entertaining. If you are captivated by one of the thumbnail images, you can download it onto your computer and then do a reverse image search on Google to find the video.</p><h2 id="4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail"></a>#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Get YouTube Thumbnail"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/" >http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Get YouTube Thumbnail is another free, straightforward tool for grabbing YouTube thumbnail images. All you need to do is paste the URL of the YouTube video and click on the “Get YouTube Thumbnail” button to retrieve your thumbnail. Yes, that’s right. One thumbnail image. What’s different about this website is that it provides you with a unique image URL. This might be useful for anyone not wanting to deal with files. While this website is free to use, it does have ads.</p><h2 id="5-Fbutube-com"><a href="#5-Fbutube-com" class="headerlink" title="#5: Fbutube.com"></a>#5: Fbutube.com</h2><p>Fbtube.com is a tool that is used to download YouTube thumbnails by bloggers, YouTubers, graphic designers, etc. This tool helps to grab all the thumbnails available for a YouTube video.

Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos. If your vlog is not suited to the great outdoors then you need to get more strategic. You can turn on all the lights in your living room and still end up with a dark, grainy, video.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting"><a href="#Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting"></a>Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt=" Lighting for YouTube Video"                ></p><p>The most common technique of lighting a scene is called <strong>three-point lighting</strong>. It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

These tips will help you make the first steps on that journey.</p><h4 id="1-Focus-Your-Key-Light"><a href="#1-Focus-Your-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Focus Your Key Light"></a>1.  Focus Your Key Light</h4><p>Try to focus your Key Light so that it lights only you and not your background. Do this by mounting anything that can cast a shadow onto your Key Light to control the area where the light hits. If you are using a window for your Key Light then you can use a curtain. If you use a softbox light then your light will already be somewhat focused.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Natural-Lighting"><a href="#2-Use-Natural-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Natural Lighting"></a>2. Use Natural Lighting</h4><p>The light provided by the Sun is still the best light source, you can have in your video. The trouble is that natural light changes quickly, which makes it highly unpredictable. The best way to deal with this challenge is to come prepared to the set and to get the shot you want as quickly as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Try-DIY-Lightning"><a href="#3-Try-DIY-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.  Try DIY Lightning"></a>3.  Try DIY Lightning</h4><p>Literally, anything from candles to LED light bulbs can serve as a source of light in a shot. You just need to pay attention to the light temperature, because warmer light sources may highlight reds and yellows that can make your footage look less realistic.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Lightning-Kits"><a href="#4-Use-Lightning-Kits" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Lightning Kits"></a>4. Use Lightning Kits</h4><p>This is by far the best option if you want to be in complete control of the light on your set. You can adjust the intensity of the lights, use filters, diffusers and all sorts of other accessories to create the light that flatters the subjects of your videos. The only downside is that you’ll have to spend a considerable amount of money if you want to have a professional lighting kit.</p><h4 id="5-Set-up-reflectors"><a href="#5-Set-up-reflectors" class="headerlink" title="5.  Set up reflectors"></a>5.  Set up reflectors</h4><p>Sets of reflectors are often under $50, so they are fairly affordable. However, some vloggers choose to forgo purchasing reflectors and make their own out of tinfoil.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips01.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If your strong main light is too hard on your eyes then you can use a translucent ‘reflector’ to soften it. Set your translucent reflector, or other screen, up in front of your main light to diffuse it.</p><p>If you are hosting a <strong>beauty vlog</strong> then you might consider a slightly different set up. Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background. The even light hitting your face will also make you look flat if you do not use a backlight.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips02.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If you are using all of the lighting options available to you and your video still looks too dark then you can try brightening it by <strong>opening up the aperture of your camera</strong> lens&#x2F;setting a lower f-stop. Letting more light into your camera can help your footage look brighter, although you also run the risk of making things look overexposed&#x2F; washed out if you are not careful.</p><p>If you are stuck shooting in <strong>low light conditions</strong> it is best to use a lens with a wider aperture&#x2F;lower f-stop. This will make the best of the light you do have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/nlock-video-insights-top-7-free-easy-to-use-tag-extraction-software-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlock Video Insights Top 7 Free, Easy-to-Use Tag Extraction Software Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-from-script-to-splendor-animating-effects-unbound/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Script to Splendor Animating Effects Unbound</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-reviving-cut-off-livestreams-solving-facebook-streaming-hiccups/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Reviving Cut-Off Livestreams Solving Facebook Streaming Hiccups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-exclusive-free-mcb-visual-tools/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Free MCB Visual Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-binge-and-float-navigating-the-pip-functionality-for-seamless-watching/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Binge & Float Navigating the PIP Functionality for Seamless Watching</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-advanced-youtube-studio-editing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Essential Guide to Advanced YouTube Studio Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-elite-sites-for-high-res-vectors-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Elite Sites For High-Res Vectors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-potential-in-your-photography-with-gopro-time-lapses/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Potential in Your Photography with GoPro Time-Lapses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-mastering-youtube-video-transformation-into-animated-gifs-no-save/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering YouTube Video Transformation Into Animated GIFs (No Save)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-navigate-video-settings-ideal-size-and-aspect-ratio-for-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Navigate Video Settings Ideal Size & Aspect Ratio for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-novel-set-of-pertinent-probing-for-podcast-participants/"><u>2024 Approved Novel Set of Pertinent Probing for Podcast Participants</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/chatgpts-impact-on-employment-what-positions-are-at-risk/"><u>ChatGPT's Impact on Employment: What Positions Are at Risk?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/erclockwise-content-youtube-replay-methods-for-2024/"><u>Counterclockwise Content YouTube Replay Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-streams-screening-netflix-on-mac-professionally/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Streams Screening Netflix on Mac Professionally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/unlocking-video-editing-on-windows-11-for-professionals/"><u>Unlocking Video Editing on Windows 11 for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-davinci-resolve-scopes-have-undergone-significant-improvements-find-out-how-to-use-these-scopes-and-improve-your-video-editing-skills/"><u>Updated In 2024, DaVinci Resolve Scopes Have Undergone Significant Improvements.

However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.</p><ul><li>Already included on many Windows-based computers</li><li>Sourcing footage from a computer or camera</li><li>Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-you-ready-for-something-better"><a href="#Are-you-ready-for-something-better" class="headerlink" title="Are you ready for something better?"></a>Are you ready for something better?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites.

Wondershare’s <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Filmora</strong> <strong>Video Editor</strong></a> is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.</p><p>What free video editing software have you tried?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-eye-twinkling-jokes-generate-on-kapwing/"><u>[New] Eye-Twinkling Jokes Generate on Kapwing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/n-2024-from-script-to-screen-youtube-video-creation-made-simple/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Script to Screen YouTube Video Creation Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ee-the-world-through-different-lenses-3-strategies-for-successful-pov-reactions-on-youtube/"><u>[New] See the World Through Different Lenses 3 Strategies for Successful POV Reactions on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-is-your-channels-income-regular-via-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Is Your Channel's Income Regular via YouTube?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-photo-cinematic-conversions-sonic-enhancements/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Photo Cinematic Conversions Sonic Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-prime-freefire-content-creation-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Prime FreeFire Content Creation on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-10-easy-youtube-video-ideas-everyone-can-make-it/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, 10 Easy YouTube Video Ideas Everyone Can Make It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-dazzle-and-stand-out-50-free-youtube-branding-pieces/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Dazzle and Stand Out 50 FREE YouTube Branding Pieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-teach-you-to-transfer-files-from-lava-blaze-curve-5g-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Ways To Teach You To Transfer Files from Lava Blaze Curve 5G to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-sharefake-gps-on-uber-for-oppo-a59-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to share/fake gps on Uber for Oppo A59 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Phone that is Locked?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/innovative-backdrop-changer-toolkit-unveiled/"><u>Innovative Backdrop Changer Toolkit Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/intellectual-abilities-of-chatgpt-upheld/"><u>Intellectual Abilities of ChatGPT Upheld</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/actics-for-identifying-potential-youtube-co-stars/"><u>Key Tactics for Identifying Potential YouTube Co-Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/seamless-setup-essential-linksys-ae2500-drivers-available-for-immediate-download/"><u>Seamless Setup: Essential Linksys AE2500 Drivers Available for Immediate Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/king-your-youtube-music-collection-a-detailed-guide/"><u>Unlocking Your YouTube Music Collection A Detailed Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

By this point, you have enough of a following that they could be called a fanbase, and you can start leveraging your platform to make money through AdSense. Once you pass 10K subscribers, it starts to become easier to find brand deals and sponsorships too. YouTube will offer an additional option of Teespring for the monetized channel at this level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Awards-Level-1"><a href="#Awards-Level-1" class="headerlink" title="Awards Level"></a>Awards Level</h2><p>When a verified YouTube channel reaches a specific milestone and is deemed eligible for a creator award, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol.</p><h3 id="4-The-Silver-Creator-Award-100K-1-million-subscribers"><a href="#4-The-Silver-Creator-Award-100K-1-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silver-creator-award.jpg"                      alt="silver creator award"                ></strong></p><p>This is the first level that comes with a trophy.

However, for almost all YouTubers, their mind will soon turn to whether they can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money from YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how much they could be making.</p><p>If you’re curious about how much money you could make from your channel, or just want to see what the potential is for creating a revenue stream once you’ve built your audience, we’ve got just the thing for you.

For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).</p><p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p><p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator"></a>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</h2><p>The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.</p><p>If you don’t know your CPM yet, don’t worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let’s take a look:</p><ul><li><a href="#videos">1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</a></li><li><a href="#channel">2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel</a></li></ul><h3 id="1-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Videos"><a href="#1-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos"></a>1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</h3><p>To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don’t know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.</p><p>From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.</p><h3 id="2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel"><a href="#2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2.

How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money"></a>2. How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money</h3><p>Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p><p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p><p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p><p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p><p>But that’s not the whole story.</p><p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p><p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p><p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform"></a>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</h2><p>If you’ve had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here’s how:</p><pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment</code></pre><p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have ‘Partner Verified’ on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-Making-Money-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-6-Making-Money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Making Money on YouTube"></a>Part 6: Making Money on YouTube</h2><p>We’ve all been seduced by the big hitters on YouTube, from PewDiePie to Lilly Singh, and have imagined that we’ll be the next YouTube millionaire.

In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p><p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p><p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p><p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p><p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p><p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p><p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p><p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p><p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p><p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p><p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p><p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p><p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p><p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p><p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p><p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p><p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p><p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p><p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p><ul><li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li><li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li><li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p><p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p><p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p><p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p><p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p><ol><li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li><li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li><li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person.

It’s a fluorescent ‘daylight’ (5400K) light, so the colors in your videos will look natural.</p><p>This light is dimmable, so you can turn it down if it’s too bright, and the Prismatic Light Stand will allow you to tilt your light to the perfect angle.

Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li><li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li><li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li><li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li><li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li><li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li><li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li></ol><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li><li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li><li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up.

In this article, we will teach you about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video formats and settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To upload a video to YouTube you have to make sure that you are using one of the video file formats that is supported by the platform itself. Here they are:</p><p>  - MP4</p><p> - MOV</p><p> - AVI</p><p> - FLV</p><p> - 3GPP</p><p> - WMV</p><p> - WebM</p><p> - MPEGS</p><p> <strong>YouTube recommends uploading your videos as MP4 files.</strong> Some benefits of MP4s are that the files are not as large as AVIs, they provide better quality than FLVs, and they often display with the same quality or better as you would get watching the video on a native video player. Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><h2

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube.

This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>.

However, it is better to complete the entire video editing process before you upload a video to your YouTube channel because YouTube Studio and other online video editing platforms still offer only a limited amount of video editing tools.

If your dream is to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it’s important to remember that regular people are doing it.</p><p>Jesse Ridgway is the owner of the vlog <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/McJuggerNuggets" >McJuggerNuggets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has grown to over 3.4 million subscribers. He makes enough money to live off of YouTube alone. Here is a case study of how he made his first $10,000 on YouTube:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets"><a href="#Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets" class="headerlink" title="Case Study of McJuggerNuggets"></a>Case Study of McJuggerNuggets</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/case-study-mcjugger-nuggets.jpg"                      alt="Case Study McJugger Nuggets"                ></p><p>Jesse was one of the earliest YouTubers. He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense"><a href="#AdSense" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.</p><h4 id="Multichannel-Networks"><a href="#Multichannel-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Multichannel Networks"></a>Multichannel Networks</h4><p>Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade"><a href="#Social-Blade" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more. It will give you a good impression of what you should be including in your videos and how you can make more money from your channel.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time"></a>Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time</h4><p>Uploading videos at the right time will make sure that you are on the front page of recently uploaded videos when people are let out of school or taking a break from work. This will earn you lots of views. Set an upload time for all of your videos each day and stick to that schedule.</p><h4 id="Check-out-Webinars"><a href="#Check-out-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Check out Webinars"></a>Check out Webinars</h4><p>Looking into webinars and videos of what other popular YouTube experts have done will help you model their success.</p><h4 id="Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers"><a href="#Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="Collaborate with Other YouTubers"></a>Collaborate with Other YouTubers</h4><p>When you create a collab video you and your partner are each introduced to each other’s subscribers.</p><h4 id="Keep-Quality-Up"><a href="#Keep-Quality-Up" class="headerlink" title="Keep Quality Up"></a>Keep Quality Up</h4><p>Putting time and effort into every upload will ensure that you won’t lose subscribers or viewers because you got a bit lazy.</p><h4 id="Do-Follow-Up-Videos"><a href="#Do-Follow-Up-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Do Follow-Up Videos"></a>Do Follow-Up Videos</h4><p>If you have a particular video that has a lot of views, you may want to consider creating follow-up videos. This can be a great way to generate lots of views.</p><h4 id="Complete-Regular-Research"><a href="#Complete-Regular-Research" class="headerlink" title="Complete Regular Research"></a>Complete Regular Research</h4><p>Regular research into your target market will help you to create the trendiest new content.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Get-Discouraged"><a href="#Don’t-Get-Discouraged" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Get Discouraged"></a>Don’t Get Discouraged</h4><p>Timing and luck are definitely two of the biggest factors in becoming a success on YouTube.

The following is a list of the <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>3 best YouTube name generators</strong></a>, an easy step-by-step for <strong>brainstorming</strong>, and instructions for updating your YouTube name.</p><p>Whether you’re a YouTuber beginner or want to improve your YouTube videos to the next level, a good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be a good helper.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. SpinXO</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2. Name Generator"></a>2. Name Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. Username Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator-generated.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator Sample"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps"></a>Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps</h2><p>The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:</p><ol><li>Tell viewers what your channel is about</li><li>Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique</li></ol><p>Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words"><a href="#Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Gather up relevant words"></a><strong>Step 1: Gather up relevant words</strong></h4><p>Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.</p><p>You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).</p><h4 id="Step-2-Combinations"><a href="#Step-2-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Combinations"></a><strong>Step 2: Combinations</strong></h4><p>Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good. Ideally, you want to get that ‘oh, that has a nice ring to it!’ feeling.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name"></a>Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name</h2><p>In the early days of YouTube, you couldn’t change your name, but now you can!</p><ol><li>Click on your account icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose settings.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit on Google</strong>.</li><li>Update your name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube"></a>Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube</h2><p>Here are several <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of YouTube channel URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of a string of numbers and letters, your channel URL included your name?

One of these leaps is the use of the <strong>chroma key background</strong>, which most people know by the more colloquial term—green screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-1.jpg"                      alt="clipper in front of green screen"                ></p><p>Chroma key, also known as green screen or blue screen, is a cool hack for seamless visual storytelling, allowing content creators to replace backgrounds with any image or video they want. This technique is widely embraced in film, television, and online content, and has opened the door to limitless creative possibilities. Aside from its ability to maximize creativity, it is also cheap to employ and convenient to set up, which has made it a staple for everyone who works with visuals.</p><p>In this simple guide, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of the <strong>chroma key effect</strong>, how it is used for video making, and how to leverage that as you perfect your visual content.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Chroma Key Work?"></a><strong>How Does Chroma Key Work?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-2.jpg"                      alt="green screen shooting"                ></p><p>Chroma Keying is done by singling out a specific color (usually green or blue) from the foreground, removing it, and replacing it with a different background (for example, a sunset). This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
