ASMR can be triggered by visual, audio, and tactile stimuli, which is the reason why most YouTubers who produce this type of content dedicate a lot of attention to the image and sound quality.

Furthermore, the vast majority of ASMR videos you can find on YouTube utilizes audio triggers to spark the autonomous sensory meridian response in one form or the other. Consequently, the quality of the audio recording determines whether or not your videos will be able to trigger ASMR. That’s why we selected some of the ASMR microphones novice and seasoned YouTubers can use to record the audio for their ASMR YouTube videos.

## Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?

Thinking that you can use any microphone you can lay your hands on to record sound for you ASMR videos is a mistake, because the quality of the recording may not be at a satisfactory level if your microphone is producing a lot of self-noise or if it is not able to pick up soft noises.

Let’s take a closer look at the features and ASMR microphone should have.

### 1. The mic’s source of power

A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.

The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.

### 2. The microphone’s recording direction

Although there are a number of direction categories of microphones, ASMR content produces commonly use Omnidirectional and Binaural mics.

As its name suggests, an omnidirectional microphone can pick up sounds from all sides, which makes it a good option if you want to record ambient sounds like brushing or tapping. However, you should also keep in mind that this type of microphone can capture background noises which may impact the overall quality of the recording.

The binaural mics are composed of two microphones are used to record the left and right channel separately. You don’t necessarily have to get a binaural microphone in order to create a binaural audio recording since you can just use two different microphones to record the left and right channels individually.

### 3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes

Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.

Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S/N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.

### Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions About ASMR Microphones

#### 1\. Should I use a USB or XLR microphone for ASMR recordings?

Although both USB and XLR microphones are frequently used to capture ASMR recordings, and XLR microphone produces a much better sound quality. So, if you want to prioritize the audio quality you should record all your ASMR videos with an XLR microphone.

However, there are quite a few affordable USB mics on the market that will enable you to capture sound in decent quality at a relatively low price.

#### 2\. Which type of microphone should be used to record ASMR sounds?

Condenser microphones are a much better option than the dynamic mics because they pick up soft sounds easily. Also, getting an XLR mic is usually a better choice than opting for a USB mic.

#### 3\. Is an omnidirectional microphone better for ASMR than the binaural mic?

The answer to this question depends on the type of ASMR video you want to create. If it is important for you to capture tapping or scratching sounds from all sides then you should choose an omnidirectional microphone.

A binaural mic will enable you to create a more immersive audio recording, but they are also more expensive.

**Conclusion**

In the world of video production, the quality of your equipment often determines how good the final product is going to be. That’s why a good microphone is one of the essential items for an ASMR artist.

Finding a good microphone you can use to record ASMR sounds shouldn’t be too difficult, because you can get a high-quality option in different price tiers. If you are on a budget, then a microphone like Blue Yeti may be a great choice, because it lets you choose between different polar patterns and it produces a great quality of sound.

On the other hand, 3Dio FS Pro II or Rode NT1-A Stereo microphones are worth investing in because they will enable you to record sound at a professional level.
