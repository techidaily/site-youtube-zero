## Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats

Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018\. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother's phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.

![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That's not all; you'll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube's payroll.

| Total video uploads                             | 858              |
| Type of videos                                  | Gaming tutorials |
| Subscribers                                     | 29 million       |
| Video views                                     | 7.5 billion      |

As said before, Dragon Ball Z was the YouTuber's first upload on the platform. Then in January 2018, he went ahead to upload PUBG videos, but his breakthrough came when he switched to GTA. Up to now, he has posted 140+ GTA 5 episodes, which are famous for their unique storylines. Interestingly, each of his GTA videos has 5+ million views.

But to be one of the most popular YouTubers, you'll need diversity. Techno Gamerz has this in abundance. His "Grandpa and Granny Two Hunters" video has 10+ million views. It's a horror game where Techno Gamerz plays the scary granny with insane tricks.

His other videos, "BeamNG" and "Just Draw," have more than 12 million and 13 million views, respectively. GTA V is the most loved by his audience, with over 30 million views.
