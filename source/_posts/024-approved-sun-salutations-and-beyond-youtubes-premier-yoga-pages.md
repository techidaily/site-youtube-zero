## Part 3: How to Start Your Own Yoga Channel on YouTube?

Just a few years back, yoga was practiced and instructed only in studios. Yoga instructors would visit studios after studios to instruct the practitioners. But the time has changed now. Most practitioners now practice yoga from home and so do the instructors. Here are a few tips on how to start your own yoga channel on YouTube.

### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.

### Tip 2\. Upload videos as scheduled

As you are instructing yoga through your YouTube channel, you need to keep your audience updated. A good way to keep them updated is creating a schedule to upload videos on a regular basis. You can also post the schedule on the description of your channel so that your audience waits for the next.

### Tip 3\. Brand the practice

Creating a brand out of yoga practicing is the next thing you can do. When people hear the name of your YouTube channel, they value it for its brand. Make it just like this. It can be under your name or your studio’s name. Nevertheless, it should propose a brand value.

### Tip 4\. Rank on SEO

The present era is full of competition. If you cannot rank among the top ones, you cannot actually get to the audience and make a business out of it. Hence, you should learn to rank on search engine optimization so that people interested in yoga get to your first.

### Tip 5\. Proper video editing

Promoting your content through videos on YouTube channel is not like doing it in person. So you need to make sure that your videos exert a similar experience as that of reality. A good initiative towards that is expert video editing. Being one of the best video editors available, Filmora can help you in this case. Also, it allows you to edit videos with minimal effort.

### Tip 6\. Collaboration with other channels

Time to time, you can collaborate with other channels to have a ‘shared audience’ who can later turn into your dedicated audience. Nevertheless, it is a no-harm method that you can try to increase traffic to your best yoga YouTube channel.

### Conclusion

The best yoga YouTube channels are not only about the yoga material. It also involves how you draw traffic to your channel, the level of your video editing, and so many more. Hopefully, you will find the tips helpful while creating your own yoga YouTube channel.
