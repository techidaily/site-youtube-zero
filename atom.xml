Your audience will majorly rely on the video title and description. The description should emphasize more on what the title is. Consider that first, and then find the kinds of tags that would correlate with both your title and description. Besides, it is the best way for your audience to quickly find your videos as the keywords will directly link them.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-go-overboard-3"><a href="#5-Don’t-go-overboard-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Don’t go overboard"></a>5) Don’t go overboard</h4><p>Even though there are no limits on words for YouTube tags, don’t use so many words; it may turn away your audience. Instead, focus on adding relevant tags but don’t stuff in keywords. Going overboard may automatically take you off the topic and mislead your audience.</p><h2 id="How-to-add-a-tag-to-a-YouTube-video-3"><a href="#How-to-add-a-tag-to-a-YouTube-video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to add a tag to a YouTube video"></a>How to add a tag to a YouTube video</h2><p>Adding the right YouTube tag will increase the chances of YouTubers finding and watching your video.

It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.</p><p>This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.</p><p>What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and <a href="#velosofy">Velosofy</a>.</p><h4 id="Movietools"><a href="#Movietools" class="headerlink" title="Movietools"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.movietools.info/" >Movietools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.</p><p>You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and&#x2F;or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.</p><p>Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.</p><h4 id="Panzoid"><a href="#Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="Panzoid"></a><a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.</p><p>A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.</p><p>Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.</p><p>In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.</p><p>The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word&#x2F;line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.</p><p>Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.</p><h4 id="Velosofy"><a href="#Velosofy" class="headerlink" title="Velosofy"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.velosofy.com/" >Velosofy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.</p><p>Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is <a href="#blender">Blender</a>, the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.</p><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Making a Great Intro"></a>5 Tips for Making a Great Intro</h2><p>Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds"><a href="#1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds"></a>1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds</h4><p>Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.</p><p>Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.</p><h4 id="2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding"><a href="#2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding" class="headerlink" title="2. Match Your Channel’s Branding"></a>2. Match Your Channel’s Branding</h4><p>Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.</p><p>Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Music"><a href="#3-Use-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Music"></a>3. Use Music</h4><p>Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.</p><h4 id="4-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#4-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="4. Include Your Channel Name"></a>4. Include Your Channel Name</h4><p>This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.</p><h4 id="5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro"><a href="#5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro"></a>5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro</h4><p>Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.</p><p> What’s your YouTube intro like?

You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p><p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p><h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p><p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p><p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p><p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p><p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p><p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p><h4 id="1-Give-Value"><a href="#1-Give-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p><p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p><p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p><p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p><p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p><p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p><p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p><h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p><p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p><p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p><p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p><h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p><p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p><p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p><p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p><h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p><h4 id="1-Be-Original"><a href="#1-Be-Original" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p><p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p><p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p><p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p><h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p><p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p><p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p><p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p><h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p><p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p><p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p><p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p><p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p><p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p><p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p><h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p><h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p><p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p><h4 id="2-Reviews"><a href="#2-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p><h4 id="3-Walkthrough"><a href="#3-Walkthrough" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p><h4 id="4-Reactions"><a href="#4-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p><h4 id="5-Skills"><a href="#5-Skills" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p><h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p><p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p><p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p><p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p><p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p><p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p><p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p><p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p><p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p><p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p><p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p><p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p><h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p><p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p><h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p><p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p><p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115908/19272" target="_top" id="2115908">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115908" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115908/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p><p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p><h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it.

And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p><p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p><ol><li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li><li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li></ol><p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement.

Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p><p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p><p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking.

Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p><p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p><p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p><p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p><p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p><h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p><p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p><p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p><p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p><p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p><p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p><p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p><p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p><p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself.

I’m a Social Worker, which means I’m always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>I’ve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I’ve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.</p><p>So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!</p><p><a href="#specificdays">1.

Don’t force yourself to post on specific days"></a>1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.</p><h2 id="2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner"><a href="#2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner"></a>2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner</h2><p>A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance"><a href="#3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG"                      alt="shorts revenue sample"                ></p><p>Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have.

Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.</p><h3 id="New-Policies-Make-YouTube-More-Competitive"><a href="#New-Policies-Make-YouTube-More-Competitive" class="headerlink" title="New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive"></a><strong>New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive</strong></h3><p>The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.</p><h3 id="Advertisers-to-Benefit"><a href="#Advertisers-to-Benefit" class="headerlink" title="Advertisers to Benefit"></a><strong>Advertisers to Benefit</strong></h3><p>The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.</p><h3 id="Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels"><a href="#Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels"></a><strong>Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels</strong></h3><p>The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.</p><p>It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Unless you garner deep insights of your competitors. You must be thinking how can you gauge their company insights using YouTube and track the data movement as well.

They contribute to generate organic traffic for you using both Google and YouTube as a medium. YouTube has a default dedicated analytics mechanism to measure how the video fares in YouTube to gain the most out of it.</p><p> Here we have collated the broadly used YouTube insights to ensure that your highly equipped, SEO compatible video engages more audience and performs well.

Views</h4><p> Though, views determine the number of people clicked on a certain video on YouTube, it’s impossible to figure out whether the video has been watched till the end or not. Moreover, they can be altered through clickbait tricks and hence YouTube doesn’t solely put much value on them.</p><p> Views along with watch time turn out to be the best bet. Watch time sums up the total amount of time spent (in terms of minutes) on your brand’ videos.

Depending on the video playing locations, the views will be segregated in to embedded video, YouTube watch page, mobile devices, and YouTube channel page. Understanding location specific views would help you decide where should you focus to enhance the performance of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-playback-location.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="3-Demographics"><a href="#3-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="3.

Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115925/19272" target="_top" id="2115925">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115925" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115925/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers.

Then, adjust it to the section of your video you want it to be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="select ai portrait filmora"                ></p><p>You can also change the AI Portrait effect settings.

Then, play the video to preview it.</p><p>Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-11.jpg"                      alt="preview edited video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Spet 7:</strong> A pop-up window will appear on your PC screen. Select where you want to save the edited video file from the Folder Path section. Then, enter the file name in Lable. Click Export to finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-12.jpg"                      alt="export edited videos filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>That’s all on T-Series income on YouTube. T-Series did not just become successful overnight. It took consistent hard work. The team put so much effort not just to come up with ideas and create videos, but also to invest in the right tools to make their videos stand out in the industry. If you’re looking to start your YouTube journey and be like T-Series some days, you should start now. The first move you should make is to invest in Wondershare Filmora software, as it has lots of tools to offer for editing videos with high quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-audio-visual-blend-in-online-photography/"><u>[New] Audio-Visual Blend in Online Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-best-no-cost-cross-platform-laptop-dvd-decoders/"><u>[New] Best No-Cost, Cross-Platform Laptop DVD Decoders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/arnings-enlightenment-joshi-and-youtube-success-stories/"><u>[New] Earnings Enlightenment Joshi and YouTube Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhancing-experience-best-audio-sources-for-unpack-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhancing Experience Best Audio Sources for Unpack Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/olutions-to-clear-up-black-space-on-youtube-watching-for-2024/"><u>[New] Solutions to Clear Up Black Space on YouTube Watching for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-step-by-step-tutorial-broadcasting-360-video-on-youtube-live/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Tutorial Broadcasting 360 Video on YouTube Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Things You Must Know about Fake Snapchat Location On Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/amazons-2018-kindle-paperwhite-a-comprehensive-bookworm-review-and-ranking/"><u>Amazon's 2018 Kindle Paperwhite - A Comprehensive Bookworm Review & Ranking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/beijings-olympic-frost-festivities-2022-edition/"><u>Beijing's Olympic Frost Festivities, 2022 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/emojis-as-financial-cues-the-aftermath-of-activision-hacking-and-chatgpt-powered-ai-implications-for-todays-workforce-and-economy/"><u>Emojis as Financial Cues, the Aftermath of Activision Hacking, and ChatGPT-Powered AI: Implications for Today's Workforce & Economy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/tial-tools-free-online-youtuber-starters-for-2024/"><u>Essential Tools Free Online Youtuber Starters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-tecno-spark-20-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Tecno Spark 20 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.</p><p>A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link"></a>How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link</h2><p>YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following to the end of your channel URL:</p><p>?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.</p><p>This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>That’s a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor’s YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub%5C_confirmation=1" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features lots of video and audio editing tools that enables you to cut, trim and touch up the video clip easily.

But even though other forms of creative expression, like art and writing, may reflect something about the personhood of their creator, very few forms of creative expression seem to shine as much of a spotlight on who you are as a person as vlogging.</p><p>When it comes to vlogging, it is your face, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thoughts, and feelings that your audience sees and hears close-up. That is why vlogging can seem even more terrifying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-fear.jpg"                      alt="Vlogging Fears"                ></p><p>Below is a list of 10 of the most common fears people have with vlogging and ways to overcome them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera"><a href="#1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera"></a>1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera</h3><p>It can be nerve-racking to talk to your camera in public, especially if your vlog set-up attracts a lot of attention (Casey Neistat’s famous rig consisting of a DSLR camera with a GorillaPod tripod and a Rode shotgun mic attached to it definitely attracts more attention than just your everyday smartphone). Despite a lot of vloggers suggesting that people don’t care as much as you think they care, it still is an activity that stands out, gets noticed, and creates curiosity, which is plenty to feel nervous about.</p><p>My advice is to start with shorter conversations with your camera in public and gradually build your way up to longer ones or save all your longer talks for when you’re in a more private setting. Short conversations may include one simple sentence about where you are going. Then, in another separate recording, in a different setting with different people, you can explain why you’re going there. If you’ve never broken up your speech like this for your vlogs, you might wonder if this will make your vlogs look disjointed. But this is actually a technique (below) that can enhance your vlogs.</p><p>As you continue to vlog in public more, you’ll become increasingly comfortable with it.</p><h3 id="2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others"><a href="#2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others" class="headerlink" title="2. Fear of Being Judged by Others"></a>2. Fear of Being Judged by Others</h3><p>After uploading your vlog online, the next thing you might worry about is being judged and criticized by anonymous haters on the internet. No matter how perfectly you present yourself, this will happen. But you will be ok.</p><p>You just need to be strongly grounded in your intrinsic worth and not take too seriously the judgments of those who don’t even know you. You can adjust your community settings on YouTube so that you have more control over others’ comments. But I suggest you just get used to others’ disapproval because it’s something that comes with putting yourself out there on such a public platform.</p><h3 id="3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough"><a href="#3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough"></a>3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough</h3><p>A lot of people fear that they aren’t interesting enough to watch. This fear stops many people from vlogging. Some people get around this self-doubt by focusing their content on something other than themselves. But people are so much more interesting than the tools and objects that they test out and review on YouTube. Even if you’re unable to secure the interest of the masses, there are bound to be a handful of people from all around the world who do find you interesting.</p><h3 id="4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough"><a href="#4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough"></a>4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough</h3><p>When you look at the vlogs of many of the top YouTubers, their lives appear so action-packed. It’s hard not to think that all vlogs are meant to be very stimulating. But if you believe that that is the standard for vlogs, you might either be discouraged and drop vlogging altogether or you might try too hard to schedule your life around getting stimulating vlog content. Neither is a good option. Face your fear of your audience getting bored and just go ahead and vlog your lifestyle just as it is.</p><h3 id="5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity"><a href="#5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity" class="headerlink" title="5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity"></a>5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity</h3><p>When you have the ability to control what others see, you may be tempted to present yourself and your life in the most likable way to avoid disapproval and rejection. But the further away from your true self that you fabricate your story, the more inauthentic you’ll feel. Embrace disapproval and rejection and understand that, no matter how perfectly you present yourself, you just can’t avoid disapproval and rejection. It’s going to happen no matter what! So you might as well present yourself just as you are.</p><h3 id="6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough"><a href="#6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough" class="headerlink" title="6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough"></a>6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough</h3><p>Fearing that your production quality won’t measure up is another common fear that holds people back from vlogging. Just get started and put something together with the equipment and skills you already have. Loosen up a bit on your rigid high standards and experience for yourself that the consequences of doing your best with what you have are not so bad. You will develop your equipment and skills as you get more and more into vlogging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134228/18498" target="_top" id="2134228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134228/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big"><a href="#7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big" class="headerlink" title="7. Fear of Failing To Get Big"></a>7. Fear of Failing To Get Big</h3><p>Getting a lot of subscribers is a common end goal for many who go into vlogging. This goal can seem impossible to reach with how crowded the vlogosphere has become with so many ambitious vloggers who are competing for views and subscribers.</p><p>How can you know for sure that you won’t be wasting your time and effort trying? The truth is… you can’t know for sure. But dismissing all of your time and effort as a waste just because you’re not at the end yet will take away from the joy you could have with vlogging. Rather than focusing on getting big, focus on enjoying the process of vlogging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment"><a href="#8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment" class="headerlink" title="8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment"></a>8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment</h3><p>Whether you’re vlogging or not, living in the present moment can already be a challenge with a smartphone. When something exhilarating happens, many of us feel compelled to pull out our phone to capture it, only to experience that fleeting moment through a small preview screen.</p><p>Vlogging appears to take that to another level, especially if you’re using complicated equipment that takes more time to set up and if you’re trying to capture enough footage to produce an entire vlog out of one day. How could all that time devoted to capturing your footage not get in the way of your present moment?</p><p>Well, like all hobbies, activities, and passions, vlogging does take time and you’re going to have to accept that it does. You may not know it now, but after giving vlogging a try, you may discover that you really enjoy it. And if you do, you won’t worry about missing out on life just as a painter who happens to be in the middle of his painting during a sunset wouldn’t worry about the sunset he’s missing out on.</p><p>If, in the end, you realize you don’t enjoy vlogging, then at least you’re left with a documented piece of a memory that you can relive again and again, which can actually help you appreciate your past moments even more.</p><h3 id="9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable"><a href="#9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable" class="headerlink" title="9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable"></a>9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable</h3><p>Even though you might have learned to enjoy and be comfortable with vlogging, your vlogging might make others uncomfortable. You can still vlog while respecting others’ boundaries by having a conversation first, before you start vlogging, around whether or not they feel comfortable with appearing in your vlog. You can then make sure to exclude those from your vlog who are uncomfortable with appearing in your vlog.</p><p>Sometimes, though, as much as you try to exclude certain people from your vlogs, they might still end up in your footage. You might even find out after you’ve captured great footage that people do not want to be in your video. In these cases, you can always censor their faces out in editing.</p><h3 id="10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark"><a href="#10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark" class="headerlink" title="10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark"></a>10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark</h3><p>Anything you make public over the internet, including vlogging, comes with the risk of making a permanent mark that won’t go away, even if you try to delete your original content later. That can definitely be a scary thing.</p><p>Luckily, with vlogging, you still have a lot of control. In both filming and editing, you can choose to share whatever you’re comfortable with sharing with the rest of the world.</p><p>In post-production, you can use some video editing software to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >delete unwanted parts from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> clip, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >blur the video background <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or adjust the video color. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is such a video editing software that has been widely used by many YouTubers;

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.
