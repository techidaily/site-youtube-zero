Just like a book with an appealing cover compels a person to pick it up and read, it is significant to display and advertise your YouTube channel in a way that makes viewers click and browse through the channel.

Despite creating a beautiful banner on your desktop screen, it might end up distorted on a mobile screen if the recommended sizes for all kinds of gadgets are not followed. Hence, choosing your YouTube channel art dimension is essential since it is the viewer's first impression. To commence with, you must be careful about your **YouTube banner size** and **channel art dimensions**. Are you wondering how to create the perfect banner or cover photo as we know it?
