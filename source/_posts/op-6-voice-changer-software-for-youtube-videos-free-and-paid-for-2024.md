There is a lot of software out there that can make you sound like a completely different person. You can change your voice for comedic effect, or to mask your identity. There are a lot of reasons you might want to change your voice in a YouTube video. If you are a YouTube gamer playing as some kind of non-human character then it might make sense for you to use a voice that suits that character for your voiceovers. Or, you might want to create multiple characters for your vlog and give them all unique voices.

There is a wide variety of voice changer software out there. Some are simple voice recorders that allow you to add a premade effect while others offer in-depth audio editing. This article will introduce you to some of the best voice changers available at different price points, from free to $100\. Because your vlog posts will rarely be live programs that only alter your voice in real-time and do not allow you to record have been excluded from this list.

AthTek’s free voice changer for Windows is a very simple program that will allow you to change the pitch and speed of your voice in an audio recording.

#### 2\. Audacity – Free

Audacity is not specifically a voice changer; it is a full-feature audio editing program for Mac or PC. If your goal is only to use a false voice then Audacity might be more complicated than you want as you will have to make all your changes manually. There are no pre-set voices, but you can change both the pitch and tempo of your audio recordings and do a lot of other detailed editings. You can record audio using Audacity, or import audio files to edit. Audacity is available at Audacityteam.org.

#### 3\. Voxal Voice Changer – Free
