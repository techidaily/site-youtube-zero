## 6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates

For even more End Screen Templates, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-youtube-end-screen-templates%21-plus%3B-how-to-build-your-301.html).

#### 1. Outro Maker

**Overview:** _Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost._

On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.

Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.

#### 2. Biteable

**Overview:** _Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free._

Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.

This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.

#### 3. Tube Arsenal

**Overview:** _Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10._

Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates/end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors/logo/images. They have template cards with slots for videos/playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.

Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).

#### 4. Renderforest

**Overview:** _Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros._

Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.

One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.

#### 5. Panzoid

**Overview:** _Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text._

Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).

#### 6. Intro Cave

**Overview:** _It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave._

As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.

Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.
