As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.

YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.

In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.

![youtube-creator-sutdio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-creator-sutdio.jpg)

But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:

\- What information it is displaying

\- What issues it addresses

\- What you can do to improve the results
  
**1\. Overview**

#### **Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis**

The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.

The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube-creator-studio-overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-creator-studio-overview.jpg)  
  
#### **Personalize Your Overview**

By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.

![data-of-specific-period](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-of-specific-period.jpg)

 If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453" border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![data-of-specific-region](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-of-specific-region.jpg)  
  
Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.
  
#### **See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview**

The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![top-performing-videos-in-overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/top-performing-videos-in-overview.jpg)  
  
#### **Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview**

In Overview you can see where the majority of your audience is from, what gender they are, how they are discovering your videos in Traffic Source, and where they are watching your video in Playback Locations:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![your-audience-in-overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/your-audience-in-overview.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use the Overview Dashboard**

The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.

If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.
  
**2\. Realtime**

#### **See The Performance of Your Channel**

The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png" border="0">Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![performance-of-your-channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/performance-of-your-channel.jpg)  
  
#### **See Performance of Your 25 Most Recently Published Videos**

In the Realtime dashboard, you will see the last 48 hours and last 60-minute performance of your 25 most recently published videos.

If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.

![most-recently-published-videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/most-recently-published-videos.jpg)  
  
#### **See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment**

If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.

\- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.

\- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.

\- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.

 If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![real-time-data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/real-time-data.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use the Realtime Dashboard**

If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.

Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.

For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.

**3\. Revenue**

#### **See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made**

Select a specific timeline and see how much your channel has made from ads and YouTube Red viewers during that duration.

There are 3 ways to change the timeline:

1. Dropdown menu

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![slide-bar-daily-view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/slide-bar-daily-view.jpg)  
  
#### **Identify Your Highest Earning Videos**

In the Revenue report, you can see which videos are earning you the most. Consider how these videos are successful:

\- Was the content great?

\- Was it the perfect length?

\- Was it a well-structured video?

\- Was the video’s pacing fast?

 Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.

![highest-earning-videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/highest-earning-videos.jpg)  
  
#### **Which Country Is Earning You the Most Money**

Different countries have different rates for how much creators can make off Adsense. Click into Geography and see how much you are making in different countries and consider which audience is best to focus your attention on with the intention of increasing revenue.

#### **Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics**

Know more about how your data are related by comparing to see if Revenue is affected by the performance of metrics in other categories such as Views. Does a rise in view change your revenue?

![revenue-earning-to-other-metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/revenue-earning-to-other-metrics.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use the Revenue Dashboard**

Figuring [how to make money on YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is tricky and any insight you can get can give you an advantage, steer you in the right direction, and help you focus on what matters.

As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.

This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.
  
**4\. Ad Rates**

 **Understanding the Ad Rates Report**

![the-ad-rates-report](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/the-ad-rates-report.jpg)  
  
**YouTube Ad Revenue:** This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.

**Estimated Monetized Playbacks:** This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.

**Playback-based CPM:** This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.

**CPM:** This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.
  
#### **See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue**

Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.

This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![monetized-videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/monetized-videos.jpg)  
  
#### **See How Each Ad Type Is Performing Within Individual Video**

Click into Ad Type and you will be able to see the performance of [different types of Ads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en) (skippable video ads, display ads, bumper ads, and non-skippable video ads.)

You can see these details from the channel level or from an individual video level.

![ad-type-within-individual-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ad-type-within-individual-video.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use Ad Rates Report**

Ad performance might not be something you think about at the early stages. You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.

But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.
  
**5\. Watch Time**

#### **See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos**

YouTube puts a lot of weight on this metric because they know that the more time people spend watching your original content, the more time they will have to show ads to your audience. Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.

![the-aggregated-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/the-aggregated-time.jpg)  
  
In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.

YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.

YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.

#### **Compare Performance of Videos in the Graph**

Put your videos side by side to compare the performance over the course of a time period.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![performance-of-videos-in-the-graph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/performance-of-videos-in-the-graph.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use Watch Time Report**

If you want to be in YouTube’s algorithm’s good books, then you will need to put some attention on your channel’s Watch Time. Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.

Some strategies include:

\- Add videos to optimized playlists

\- Improving titles and thumbnails

\- Increase YouTube subscribers

\- Add annotations to your videos

\- Add end cards to your videos

**6\. Audience Retention**

#### **See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos**

Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.

In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.

1. **Average View Duration** shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.
2. **Average Percentage Viewed** shows how much the average person watched from your videos.

In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.

While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).

![average-view-duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/average-view-duration.jpg)  
  
#### **See Audience Retention of Individual Videos**

**Absolute Audience Retention:** This report shows you the number of views at every point in the video as a percentage. This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.

![absolute-audience-retention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/absolute-audience-retention.jpg)  
  
**Relative Audience Retention:** This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.

If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.

![relative-audience-retention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/relative-audience-retention.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use Audience Retention**

Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.

However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.

In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how-to-use-audience-retention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg)

Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.

**7\. Demographics**

 **Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience**

The first thing you’ll see when you enter the Demographic dashboard is the segmentation of your audience by age and gender. This gives you a good indication of who your overall channel is currently attracting.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![demographics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/demographics.jpg)  
  
#### **See Most Popular Videos Viewed By A Specific Demographic**

Learn about the videos that are most popular within that demographic to get better insights to what is most appealing for that group.

You will also see the Watch Time percentage that each video gets in comparison with all the videos in your channel.

 Data Split by Age:

![data-split-by-age](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-split-by-age.jpg)  
  
Data Split by Gender:

![data-split-by-gender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-split-by-gender.jpg)  
  
#### **See Geographic Distribution of Different Demographics**

Not only will you be able to see which region the majority of your viewerships are from, but you can also segment and compare by demographics. This will give you a more insightful view of how your channel is performing across the world for different people.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723" border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![geographic-distribution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/geographic-distribution.jpg)  
  
Additionally, you can click into specific videos on your channel and see how it is performing in different regions.

#### **How to Use Demographics Report**

Understanding which group makes up the majority of your viewership will help you decide how to strategize the next phase of content. Will you keep growing that audience or will you want to grow in another demographic?

If you noticed that you have an underperforming female demographic in India, you can plan out some content that focus on that community. Without this report, you cannot see where you are missing opportunities.
  
**8\. Playback Locations**

 **Find Out Where People Are Watching Your Videos**

There are a number of ways people can watch your YouTube video:

\- YouTube Watch Page

\- YouTube Channel Page

\- Embedded Video Player (Website or App)

\- Other

If your video is only promoted organically your views will likely be coming from the YouTube Watch Page, but if other media publications embedded your video, and it’s getting a lot of views, you can see it here.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg" border="0">Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![playback-locations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/playback-locations.jpg)  
  
#### **Which External Source Are Your Videos Being Watched**

By clicking into the Embedded in External Websites and Apps report, you’ll be able to see all the different websites and apps that your video is featured on. This will give you a good indication of which sites and apps are driving the most views.

![external-source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/external-source.jpg)  
  
#### **How to Use Playback Locations Report**

Knowing where your videos are being played back is important, especially if you are getting a lot of views from an external source.

You can reach out to the website that has embedded your video and thank them for sharing your content, and maybe they will be happy to share more. This way you create a relationship with them, which can increase your network and also improve the chances of your videos being discovered.
  
**9\. Traffic Sources**

 **Find Out How People Are Discovering Your Videos**

In the Traffic Sources report, you can see what is the most popular way your video is being discovered.

This can include advertisements that you pay for, external referrals such as links from other websites, suggested videos, and searches on YouTube to name a few.

![traffic-sources](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/traffic-sources.jpg)  
  
#### **See Which Videos Are Suggesting Yours To Viewers**
