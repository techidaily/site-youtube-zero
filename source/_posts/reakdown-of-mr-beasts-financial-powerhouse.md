Here’s a brief outlook on the few steps you need to carry out to make or edit a video and make it more engaging.

**Steps to create or edit a video in Filmora:**

You need to have downloaded a trial version of [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) before you begin:

##### Step1 Import files

By clicking on ‘import,’ you can access the folder to browse the videos you need.

This software gives easy access to videos necessary for the edit and helps you manage them later during the edit. All the files are in the album shown in the left tray, and the ones needed can be displayed in the right window by double-clicking them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##### Step2 Insert the video in timelines

To insert a video in the timeline section, drag and drop the files from the media library that will serve as the background video in the first track, then drag and drop another video that you want to add on top of the background video in the second track.

![insert the video in timelines](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-6.jpg)

##### Step3 Alter Speed and Duration Settings

You may alter the duration of the video using the Speed and Duration Settings.

Similarly, if you want to add more than one video together, you can carry out the same process on multiple tracks to share the same frame.

**Effects:**

Go to the top menu and click on effects; you can find many of them; they are categorized in the left vertical menu.
