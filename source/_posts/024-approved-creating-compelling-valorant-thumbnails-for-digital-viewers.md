## What Is Valorant?

Valorant is a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games. The game was released in June 2020 and has quickly gained popularity due to its high-stakes, team-based gameplay and unique characters.

In Valorant, players choose from a roster of agents, each with their abilities and playstyle, and compete in 5v5 objective-based matches. The game has a variety of game modes, including the popular "Spike Rush" mode, which features a shorter round time and special abilities for all players. Valorant is available on Microsoft Windows and will soon be available on other platforms.
