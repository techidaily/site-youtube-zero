YouTube is a video platform where people share informative and entertaining content. It works in the form of channels belonging to individuals or companies. People can subscribe to these channels to show support, and YouTubers create a strong sense of community with these subscribers.

But some people comment inappropriate comments that can cause the community harm and spread hatred. Many YouTubers may want to delete such remarks. There are also times when you accidentally comment on a channel’s comment section and may wish to delete it.

So how do you delete all YouTube comments? In this how-to blog, we will show you.

## How to Delete All YouTube Comments from Mobile?

The steps to deleting someone else’s YouTube comments from your mobile are similar to those from your desktop.

You can do this both from your desktop or your phone with some easy steps.

To find your History from your desktop, you need to click on the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the homepage. You will find the History option from the list. To access it from your phone, click on the Library option at the bottom of your homepage, and it will open a list where you will find the History option.
