## Easy Transition From Local to Global: Stream Spotify Playlists on YouTube

Do you want to transfer your playlist to YouTube Music from Spotify? After all, there are some significant advantages to using the former over the latter. For one, YouTube Music offers a broader range of songs and videos without ads.

So, if you're ready to **convert Spotify playlists to YouTube Music**, let's get started!
