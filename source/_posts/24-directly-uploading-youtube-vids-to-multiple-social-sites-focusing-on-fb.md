## Extra Tip: Facebook Video Tips for more Views and Shares

Here, your main aim is to convince your viewers. So, don’t let them spend so much time before you catch their attention. You can bring up a point about some latest news or adventures that let your viewers connect immediately.

#### \- Add captions to the video

#### \- Emphasize on one key-point

Focus on one key point so that your viewers are not swayed away. Your video is highly sharable if it is easy to understand.

#### \- Add a Call To Action

Including a call-to-action will encourage your viewers to subscribe to your channel. Ensure you include it at the end of your video to tell viewers what to do next. You could also include a link to your blog post to let your viewers read and find more content from your other channels.

#### \- Facebook ads can make a great difference

Facebook is a great place for running ads that reach a wider audience. Adverts are great ways to target a specific audience. They explain your products and services more straightforwardly.

#### \- Embed your videos on blog posts

Numerous people get to access guest posts and blog posts. You can embed your Facebook videos on such posts to reach more people. Just get the embed code from your video, then copy and paste it to a guest or blog post.
