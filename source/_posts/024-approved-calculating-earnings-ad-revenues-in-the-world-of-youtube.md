The YouTube monetization rates vary significantly because of various factors:

* The number of views a video receives
* The number of clicks an ad receives
* Ad blockers
* Ad Quality
* Video length

## **Part 2\. How Much Do YouTubers Make Per 1,000 Views**

A YouTube channel is a great way to generate revenye. Quality content attracts a large audience, enabling a way to generate ad revenue. Although it may be difficult to grow a YouTube channel, the revenue generated is worth. The youtube monetization rates determine the amount you can earn for every 1,000 views on your videos.

Allowing advertiser to run their ads on your channel through Google AdSense is an effective way of monetizing YouTube Content. The advertisers pay YouTube to display their products on the platform. YouTube then pays YouTubers for displaying the ads on their videos. Although the YouTube monetization rates may vary, overall revenue generated is usually substantial.

Each view will generate $0.10 to $0.30 or an average of $0.018\. The YouTuber will be paid $18 on average for a video with 1,000 ad views. The amount paid depends on the CPM (Cost per Mille), which is the cost of advertising to 1,000 people. Brands will incur between $4 and $24 on YouTube to advertise on YouTube. However, the revenue generated by the Youtuber will be lower because not all the 1,000 views will be ad views.

![average youtube earnings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-cpm-rates-how-much-do-youtubers-make-2.JPG)

Most YouTubers report to earn around $5 to $7 from 1,000 views of their videos. Here is a breakdown of the earnings from this:

* Top talent on YouTube will likely earn $5 per 1,000
* Garnering 1 million views will earn the YouTuber $5,000
* Garnering 1 million views with 5 videos will earn the YouTuber $25,000

The figures above are just estimates. YouTubers often make more or less this amount.

## **Part 3\. How Many Views Do YouTubers Need to Get Paid?**

To get paid from revenues, you need to be eligible for the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The following is the eligibility criteria.
