* **Add filters and stickers:** The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.

## It May Interest You – Make YouTube Thumbnails on Windows/Mac

While it's convenient to create YouTube thumbnails on your mobile device, there may be times when you need to create a thumbnail on your Windows or Mac computer.

For example, if you need to create a thumbnail with a higher resolution or more advanced customization options, you may find it easier to do so on a computer. Additionally, a computer may be more efficient if you're working on a larger thumbnail project and need to create multiple thumbnails simultaneously.

## People Also Ask

Here are some common questions that people have when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails on mobile.

### Q1\. What App Do Youtubers Use To Make Thumbnails?

There are many different apps and tools that YouTubers use to create thumbnails for their videos. The best app for creating YouTube thumbnails will depend on your needs and skill level.

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail on your mobile device, start with the built-in Photos app or a third-party app like Canva. If you need more advanced customization options or are comfortable with graphic design software, consider using Adobe Photoshop or another tool.

### Q2\. What Is YouTube Thumbnail Size?

The recommended size for YouTube thumbnails is 1280 x 720 pixels. This size balances quality and file size, ensuring that your thumbnail looks sharp and loads quickly. It's also important to note that YouTube thumbnails are displayed at different sizes depending on the device and context in which they are viewed.

For example, a thumbnail may be displayed at a larger size when it's shown as the main thumbnail for a video but smaller when it's shown in a list of related videos.

### Q3\. What Thumbnail Gets the Most Clicks?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the thumbnail that gets the most clicks can vary depending on the topic of your video, your target audience, and other factors.

However, the key to getting clicks on your thumbnail is to make it visually appealing and relevant to your video. Experiment with different thumbnail designs and track which ones get the most clicks to help you identify what works best for your channel.

## Conclusion

Many tools are available for creating YouTube thumbnails, including the built-in Photos app on mobile devices and third-party apps like Pixelab. One particularly powerful option is Filmora, a video editing software with features for creating custom thumbnails, such as adding text, graphics, and special effects.

Whether you create your thumbnails on your mobile device or your computer, use a high-quality image and make the thumbnail relevant to your video to increase the chances of it getting clicked.
