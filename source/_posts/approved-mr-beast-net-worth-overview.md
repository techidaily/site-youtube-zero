The most unique thing about Mr. Beast’s videos is that he has the least appearance in them. He mostly focuses on something that the viewers can engage with: the contestants, the unique and expensive video sets and the storyline. If you have to watch a video just to learn a way to earn a $100,000, won’t you do it?

Here’s the typical flow of a MrBeast video:

1. He introduces a challenge
2. He then explains the rules
3. He announces a reward (Cash/ Merchandise/ Car)
4. He then follows the contestants as they face the challenge
5. Lastly he gives the winner lots of money

**Skillfully Edited Videos**

Mr. Beast’s carefully crafted videos have a unique element of motion graphics throughout his video that not only make the video colorful and interactive. Moreover, each clip is only seconds long, which creates a fast yet exciting pace for his content, that makes you hooked to the video.

Have a look at his most viewed video that captured around 245 million views. It showcased a Real-life Squid Game challenge!
