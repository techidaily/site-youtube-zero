[Clideo](https://clideo.com/cut-video) is not only easy to use, but it’s safe too. It helps you cut parts of the video in just a few steps, and it’s completely free! Furthermore, it will delete the user information in 24 hours. Clideo also works even if you don’t log in or register.

You just need to follow the simple steps below to download the part of the YouTube video.
