 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Coming up with new recipes that will impress everyone you know is a simple mission. You just have to go to YouTube and find the dish you'd like to prepare, but there are thousands of food YouTubers which makes it a bit difficult to decide which ones you should follow.

Naturally, you shouldn't expect anything but the best from the chefs offering advice on how to prepare a certain dish. To help you narrow down the search we've compiled a top ten list of food YouTubers, that will hopefully help you discover your new favorite meals. Let's take a peek at the most influential food channels on YouTube.

## Top Food YouTubers

Eating healthy, delicious meals improves the quality of our lives. These YouTube channels may assist you in improving your diet while learning how to prepare dishes that are tasty and nourishing at the same time. Want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers? Try [InflueNex](https://www.influenex.com/) YouTube Influencer Marketing Platform to get the details.

#### 1. Rosanna Pansino

This 33-year-old actress and YouTube personality is best known for her baking show titled **_Nerdy Nummies_** that has featured celebrities such as Michelle Phan or Bethany Mota. In 2015 Rosanna published a book under the same title, which included recipes and step by step tutorials on how to prepare them.

Her YouTube channel has over 10 million subscribers and 2.395 million total views and yet her popularity is expected to continue to grow. Besides being a great cook, Pansino is also an aspiring actress who appeared in a number of TV shows.

#### 2. Cooking With Dog

After more than a decade and nearly 300 episodes, this unorthodox cooking show is still one of YouTube's best sources of Japanese dishes. The show is hosted by an anonymous Chef and a dog named Francis. If you are interested in Japanese cuisine you can also check out the website [Cooking With Dog](https://cookingwithdog.com/) the offers meal planners and a list of recipes that include more than 300 dishes.

With 1.4 million subscribers and 185 million views this unusual YouTube food channel now has a cult following, especially because Francis died in 2016.

#### 3. Binging With Babish

Andrew Rea is a young New York-based filmmaker who had a brilliant idea to recreate dishes featured in movies and TV shows, back in 2006\. Even the channel's name is based on a fictional character Oliver Babish from the TV series The West Wing. The viewers of Rea's food videos can only see his torso and some parts of the kitchen, which adds a touch of mystery to this remarkable channel.

The Binging With Babish YouTube channel has 2.7 million subscribers and it is easily one of the best sources of unusual recipes on YouTube. Andrew Rea has also published a book in October 2017, titled **_Eat What You Watch: A Cookbook for Movie Lovers_**, that contains forty recipes from some of the best movies ever made.

#### 4. You Suck at Cooking

The perfect blend of cooking tips and humor have made this YouTube channel famous. Don't expect to find the secret recipes for the most brilliant dishes ever invented because most videos are aimed at inexperienced cooks who are bored of eating at restaurants.

The channel has been online since 2014, and in such a short period of time it has attracted over 100 million views and it currently has 1.2 million subscribers. The motto 'No Bullshit, Just Cooking' sums up perfectly the first-person videos featured on this channel.

#### 5. Tasty

If you would like to find out where do fortune cookies come from or how to make a four flavor cheesecake, you should start following this channel. Tasty is actually run by BuzzFeed's division that produces all content related to food and beverages. All recipes on this channel are divided into four categories, Tasty Junior, Tasty Happy Hour, Tasty Story, and Mom Vs Chef.

Tasty is present on all major social networks, including Facebook and Instagram. The YouTube channel has 8.2 million subscribers and their most viewed video **'7 Easy Chicken Diners'** currently has over 10 million views.

#### 6. Jamie Oliver

You probably already know Jamie from his TV show '**_The Naked Chef'_** or you've read one of his books, but a lot of people don't know that he has been a YouTuber since 2006\. Oliver's channel was created in 2006, and during the last twelve years, it has amassed over 3.7 million subscribers.

The British chef and restaurateur is a great source of delicious recipes from all around the world but just be prepared that most of the meals Jamie cooks require an advanced culinary skill set.

#### 7. Laura in the Kitchen

The Laura Vitale's YouTube channel is unquestionably the best place on the Internet to find out more about Italian food. Besides being a YouTuber that has 3.1 million subscribers, Laura is also a host of several TV shows. Laura in the Kitchen show started on YouTube in 2010, and in the last eight years, it has attracted millions of viewers.

Besides preparing dishes from Italian cuisine, Laura is also famous for preparing delicious desserts, milkshakes, and smoothies.

#### 8. SORTEDfood

This channel was started in May 2010 by a group of school friends. Ben Ebbrell, Mike Huttlestone, Jamie Spafford, and Barry Taylor realized that they all have dietary problems, and they decided to do something about it. Today their company has fourteen employees who help them produce and advertise their food videos.

SORTEDfood channel has a worldwide following with over 1.8 million subscribers and their videos are more focused on food tips than on the process of preparing the dishes. Even so, this team of British food enthusiasts is still worth following.

#### 9\. Epic Meal Time

You may not want to eat everything you see on this channel, because Harley Morenstein, the show's host, has built his reputation by preparing high-calorie meals. This Canadian and a group of his friends have started the Epic Meal Time channel in 2010, and in the last eight years, celebrities like Kevin Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger have made guest appearances.

The show has won a number of awards, which clearly shows that Epic Meal Time combines entertainment with food in a most captivating way.

#### 10. Gordon Ramsay

Gordon Ramsay's career has been so successful that it is hardly surprising that his YouTube channel has 6.6 million subscribers. Over the last twenty years, Ramsy had his own TV shows, made guest appearances on a number of shows hosted by other celebrities and he managed to acquire restaurants all over the world.

His YouTube channel was created in 2006 and it has more than a billion total views. He is also quite famous for his no-nonsense approach to aspiring cooks that often shatters their illusions of becoming great culinary masters.

**Conclusion**

If you're feeling a bit fed up with your diet and you want to shake things up a bit, then YouTube is a great place to start. You can find great recipes and step by step tutorials that will show you how to prepare them. The YouTube channels we featured in this article are among the very best you can find, but there still hundreds of channels you should check out if you're looking for a particular cuisine.
